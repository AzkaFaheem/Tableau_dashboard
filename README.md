# Daikibo Factory Breakdown Analysis (Tableau Project)

This project analyzes telemetry data from Daikibo's 4 factories to determine which location and machine types experienced the most breakdowns over May 2021.

---

## Goals
- Identify the factory with the most frequent machine breakdowns.
- Pinpoint the most problematic machine types at that location.

- - Time Period: May 2021
- Factories:
  - Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
  - Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
  - Berlin (Germany)
  - Shenzhen (China)
- 9 machine types per factory, sending signals every 10 minutes
